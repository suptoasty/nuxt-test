Created a news app using nativescript vanilla. (Would not recommend! Docs for NS are terrible unless you want to use angular or vue).

My dislike of the documentation aside using nativescript after learning how it worked was neat.

They have two apps you can download on your android that allows you to work on your app with edits changing in real time.

The best part about this is, you do not.....need.....anything from the android sdk! (unless using plugins from their marketplace)

You just type tns preview, scan the qr code with their playground app, wait a little bit, then you can start interacting with your application as you develop it.
