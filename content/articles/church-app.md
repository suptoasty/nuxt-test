<p>This project was made in an Agile / Scrum team at O.C. for the administration of a local church. These members of the administration acted as mock clients. They were not up for replacing their current system, but loved to see what would be possible under a custom software solution. We interfaced with them to gather acceptance criteria and other information about how the system would meet their needs. My team also demonstrated our progress on the application for these "clients" several times (after the end of every other sprint).</p><p>It allows for the full management of church members info, family info, family relationships, etc. The system provides event planning tools and SMS / Email announcement functionality.</p><p>It was developed in 5 sprints using Vue.js, Node.js with Express.js + Sequelize, and was tested on an Amazon AWS instance (no longer up).</p><p>I would normally provide git repository links to the Front and Backend; however, access is currently not under my discretion. I plan to fork and de-personalize the project sometime in the near future.</p>
