A simple risc computer emulator made in microsoft excel....yes....really

Notes:
The memory is a decimal form of machine code. After reading this you may have quietly asked yourself, "Why decimal?". Or "Why not hex?". Well?! I can't exactly remember why the program uses decimal?! I clearly use hex and binary in the image below. I could change it, but feel it would be unnecessary as the decimal machine code works fine (isn't bad to read either).
