<p>
    My Professor for Software Engineering IV came up with a great project to help his students experience a product dev cycle. He split the project into 3 parts and assigned each part as a new subprojects throughout the course.
</p>

<p>
    The first sprint was a simple course plan. The following sprints 2 and 3 were an expansion on the course plan. For these two, we were tasked with making a full suite of tools to help an academic advisor create course plans with their students.
</p>

<p>
    We all used agile / scrum methodology for each team. My team worked well with each other during each sprint. The only draw back was that we assigned too much during each sprint; however, we did get a lot done each week. We were just too ambitious and assigned two weeks worth of work instead of one. Despite this each team member did about 1 (1/2) weeks worth of work, leaving 2-3 items left in the storyboard at the end of each sprint.
</p>

<p>
    We split the team into two roles: backend and frontend programmers. I had the most frontend experience out of the rest of the team. This led me to volunteer for the backend development. My partner on this area started by creating our data model. Here it is:

    He made some test data based off this model. We revised, wrote, revised, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Eventually we finished the backend and we started helping the frontend team finish up the bells and whistles of the project. For a better look at the project here are the GitHub repos:
