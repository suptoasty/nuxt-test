<p>Well banner ads for, "Make your own site with ____", finally got to me. As a test of my skills over winter break I decided to use firebase, Vue (with composition api), Quasar, and Quasar-Tiptap in order to create a new site for myself.</p><p>The app is all frontend, relying on firebase for features like auth, hosting, CRUD api routes, etc. Quasar allowed for a responsive material design. Quasar-Tiptap made rich text editing easy. And Vue is just <strong><u>the best</u></strong> js framework available.</p><p>Currently I have a dev build in order to use different tools, like my blog cms and a production build which strips all of these admin tools out. Why do this? Well I can't afford to hire someone for security and I have to back things up manually, so I wanted less tools for someone to potentially exploit. The best security is to not have anything to protect ;)</p><p>A few goals I had when starting this project was to create a responsive, fast, site with custom tools that meet my needs. I believe that I have met these goals. I still need to focus on improving the UX and design of the site as well as adding in more info from my <a href="https://jasonlonsinger.wordpress.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">previous</a> WordPress site.</p><p></p><p></p>
